The releases are now combined into single releases.  You'll want the latest Cryptohaze-Combined release for your platform.

Note that, as of now, all the releases are 64-bit only.  It IS possible to build a 32-bit release, but the rainbow table tools will not work on large files as 32-bit binaries (memory mapping of large files cannot be done in 32-bit processes).  If you need a 32-bit Multiforcer, or a 32-bit table generation tool, it can be done.  If you would like to see 32-bit releases for some reason, let me know.

CHANGELOG:

=== 1.31 ===
All tools: Build against CUDA 4.2
Multiforcer: Add IP address cracking scripts
Multiforcer: Fix issue that could prevent finding all hashes in certain cases


=== 1.30 ===
Multiforcer: Added proper resume support.
Multiforcer: Added "robust workunit" support to retry failed workunits if a network client disconnects.
GRTCrack: Added --debugdump to dump candidate hashes and chains for debugging and benchmarking.
GRTCrack: Fixed a bug in which multiple passwords found in a table would lead to an incorrect cracked hash count.
GRTCrack: Number of prefetch threads is now displayed in the status pane.
GRTCrack: Table filename only displayed instead of full path to prevent annoying line wrapping.
All tools: Should have better help output for command line syntax.
GRTCrack: WebTables will now skip the final candidate hashes by default to prevent disclosure of target hashes to the WebTables server.
GRTCrack: Fix a bug with large files on Windows that leads to incorrect number of chains being checked.
GRTMerge: Added --movesorted flag to move sorted files to a completed directory.
Multiforcer: Added --devdebug flag for developer debug output.
