/**
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * 
 * The class MFNHashType is the reimplementation of CHHashType for
 * support of multiple platforms.  All the device-specific functionality
 * is to be in subclasses for the platform type and hash type.
 * 
 * The base class and general derived classes (MFNHashTypePlain, etc) will be
 * purely platform agnostic.  ALL the device functionality MUST be contained
 * within subclasses!
 * 
 * This allows for more flexibility with pre-processing hashes for improved
 * performance and for pushing more and more varied data to the device for 
 * cracking to support algoriths such as IKE, WPA, and file cracking.
 * 
 * This class can only be used for one type of device at a time - CPU, CUDA, 
 * or OpenCL.  If multiple devices are needed, the calling code must make 
 * multiple versions of this class with the required devices set up for each 
 * instance.
 *
 * Static variables are used for data that will be across all classes.  This
 * goes up to the HashTypePlain type classes - the device-specific classes
 * will have their own data.
 * 
 * Class derivation is as follows:
 * 
 * MFNHashType: The very base class for all hash types, all devices.  This
 * keeps the basic functionality, adding devices, and the basic device functions
 * that must be implemented by all classes as virtual functions.
 * 
 * MFNHashTypePlain: This class implements a generic plain hash type.  This
 * includes getting the hashes, running the kernels (generically), etc.  This
 * does not have any device specific code.
 * 
 * MFNHashTypePlainCUDA: This class implements CUDA specific functions for
 * the plan hash type - allocating memory, freeing memory, transferring data
 * to the device, etc.
 * 
 * MFNHashTypePlainCUDAMD5: This is the final leaf class node, and implements
 * the MD5 specific kernels/calls/etc to do MD5 cracking with CUDA.
