This directory contains various files related to the Cryptohaze use of
Google Protocol Buffers.  They seem like a great way to transfer data between
classes and form network RPC streams.  Almost like they were designed to do
exactly that by really, really smart people.  The binary protocol is quite
tightly packed, the interfaces are easy, and I no longer have to worry nearly
as much about network versioning with this.  So, great option going forward
(I think) and I'll be trying it out.

http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ is a good place to start reading on them.
