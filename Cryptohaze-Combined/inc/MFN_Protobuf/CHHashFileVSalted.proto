// Protobuf definition for the salted hash file type.
// This is focused on sending *uncracked* hashes around over the network.  The
// cracked hashes don't need to be sent in bulk to the remote system.  There is
// also a buffer defined for sending the cracked hashes back to the server.
// This sends salted hash/value pairs around as needed.
