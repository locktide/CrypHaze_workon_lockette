/**
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 * CHHashFileVPlain is an implementation of the CHHashFileV class for 
 * plain (unsalted/simple) hash types such as MD5, NTLM, SHA1, etc.
 * 
 * This class deals with files that have one hash per line, in ASCII-hex 
 * notation, newline separated.  It is provided the length of the hash and 
 * will ignore hashes that are not the correct length in the file.
