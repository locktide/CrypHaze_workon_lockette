/*
 * This file defines a charset class that will be used in all the Cryptohaze
 * tools going forward.  It implements the charset as a vector of vectors, not
 * a big long ugly character array with harcoded constant offsets into it.
 *
 * The charset class also supports adding charset values as hex values,
 * including null bytes.  This will probably require new network versions
 * to handle, but for now the class will have the ability to export the "old"
 * charset array of bytes to functions as need it.  When receiving this data,
 * assume that the data is a null terminated string.  Other algorithms such as
 * SL3 will handle this by defining charsets as needed.
