/**
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * MFNHashTypePlainCPU implements the CPU specific functions for plain hash
 * types.  This is a rough duplicate of functions in CHHashTypePlain for the
 * existing type.
 *
 * This class implements a subset of the device functionality needed for doing
 * CPU based SSE2 cracking.  Many of the functions are nulled out because they
 * are not needed - the CPUs can directly access the bitmaps/hash lists/etc.
 * 
 * The code is treated as far as the rest of the code goes as a kernel of vector
 * width (interleave * 4) * CPU_Threads - so a 4-thread instance with 3-way 
 * interleave would be (12 * 3) * 4 = 144-vector kernel.  The kernel handles
 * launching the threads such that they all run in parallel - the calling
 * code only specifies the number of threads to use.
 * 
 * The vector width is set by define - I'm not sure what the optimum vector
 * width for the CPUs is, so this lets us try different options.
 * 
 * Possibly smaller bitmaps would be good too - I will see what performance
 * looks like!
